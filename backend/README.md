# Infinite Alchemist - Backend

This is the backend for the Infinite Alchemist game, a creative element combination game powered by LLMs.

## Setup

1. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
```

2. Activate the virtual environment:
```bash
# On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate

# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Set up environment variables by copying `.env.example` to `.env` and filling in the required values:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

## LLM Service

The LLM service is responsible for handling element combinations using a language model. It supports both OpenAI and Hugging Face models, with Hugging Face being the default.

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables are used by the LLM service:

- `LLM_PROVIDER`: The LLM provider to use (default: "huggingface")
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: The OpenAI API key (required if using OpenAI)
- `LLM_API_KEY`: The Hugging Face API key (required if using Hugging Face)
- `LLM_MODEL`: The Hugging Face model name (default: "lightblue/suzume-llama-3-8B-multilingual")
- `REDIS_URL`: The Redis URL for caching (optional)

## Using the Prompt Tester

The prompt tester is a tool for testing different prompts with the LLM service. It helps you find the most effective prompt for element combinations.

### Running the Prompt Tester

To run the prompt tester:

```bash
python -m app.scripts.test_prompts
```

This will test all available prompts with a set of predefined element combinations and print the results.

### How the Prompt Tester Works

1. The prompt tester loads all available prompts from the `app/prompts` directory.
2. It tests each prompt with a set of predefined element combinations.
3. It evaluates the results based on success rate, errors, and invalid JSON responses.
4. It prints the results and saves detailed results to a JSON file.

### Adding Custom Prompts

You can add custom prompts to the `app/prompts` directory. Each prompt should be a text file with the following format:

```
You are the Infinite Alchemist, a game about combining elements to create new ones.

TASK:
Combine {element1} and {element2} to create a new element.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. Elements can ONLY be combined if they have a logical relationship.
2. Physical elements (like Water, Fire, Earth) can be combined with other physical elements.
3. Abstract concepts (like Love, Democracy, Philosophy) CANNOT be combined with physical elements.
4. Elements from completely different domains with no connection CANNOT be combined.
5. Combinations that violate the laws of physics or common sense are NOT allowed.
6. If the combination is valid, return a JSON object with the new element's name and an appropriate emoji.
7. If the combination is invalid or nonsensical, return a JSON object indicating it's impossible with a brief explanation.

RESPONSE FORMAT:
For valid combinations:
```json
{{
"valid": true,
"result": "New Element Name",
"emoji": "ðŸ”¥"
}}
```

For invalid combinations:
```json
{{
"valid": false,
"reason": "Brief explanation of why this combination is impossible"
}}
```

Now, combine {element1} and {element2}:
```

### Adding Test Cases

You can add custom test cases to the prompt tester by modifying the `test_cases` list in the `PromptTester` class:

```python
self.test_cases = [
    # Basic combinations
    ("Water", "Fire", "Steam"),
    ("Earth", "Fire", "Lava"),
    ("Water", "Earth", "Mud"),
    ("Fire", "Air", "Smoke"),
    
    # More complex combinations
    ("Gold", "Silver", "Alloy"),
    ("Tree", "Axe", "Wood"),
    ("Flour", "Water", "Dough"),
    ("Dough", "Fire", "Bread"),
    
    # Abstract combinations
    ("Knowledge", "Power", "Wisdom"),
    ("Time", "Money", "Efficiency"),
    
    # Nonsensical combinations that should be handled gracefully
    ("Nonsense", "Gibberish", None),
    ("12345", "67890", None),
    ("", "", None),
]
```

Each test case is a tuple of `(element1, element2, expected_result)`. If `expected_result` is `None`, the combination is expected to be invalid.

## Running Tests

To test the LLM service with refusals:

```bash
python -m app.scripts.test_refusals
```

To test the game API with a mock LLM service:

```bash
python -m app.scripts.test_game_api
```
