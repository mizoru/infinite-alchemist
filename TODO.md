## üõ†Ô∏è Recent Fixes (Session Notes)

### Backend Fixes
1. Fixed database initialization issues with the `DBElement` model
   - Updated relationships between models to use the correct model names
   - Modified the initialization of basic elements to use boolean `True` instead of integer `1` for the `is_basic` attribute
2. Resolved validation errors in the API response for the `discovered_by` field
   - Updated the API endpoints to properly handle the `discovered_by` field
   - Ensured proper conversion of database objects to dictionaries for API responses
3. Fixed SQLAlchemy query error
   - Changed `Element` to `DBElement` in all queries to use the correct model
   - Fixed the naming conflict between the SQLAlchemy model and the dataclass
4. Fixed Pydantic validation errors
   - Updated the Element schema to handle the `discovered_by` field correctly
   - Modified API endpoints to convert database objects to dictionaries
   - Added support for both boolean and integer values for `is_basic`
5. Added Russian language support for the backend
   - Created Russian translations for basic elements in the database
   - Added Russian prompt templates for the LLM
   - Updated the LLM service to handle language selection
   - Fixed error handling in the LLM service
   - Updated the API to handle language parameter in requests

### Frontend Fixes
1. Fixed element visibility issues in the library
   - Updated the `addBasicElements` function to handle both boolean and numeric `is_basic` values
   - Added debugging tools to trace data flow between components
2. Added console logging to help debug API responses and element processing
3. Completely redesigned the Workbench component:

   - Added ability to drag elements around on the workbench
   - Implemented element combination by dropping one element onto another
   - Removed the limit of only 2 elements on the workbench
   - Added proper position tracking for elements on the workbench
4. Fixed drag and drop functionality:
   - Added extensive console logging for debugging

- Basic elements are now visible in the library component
- Workbench now allows free-form placement and combination of elements
- Elements can be added to the workbench by dragging from the library or clicking on them
- Elements can be moved around freely on the workbench with proper dragging behavior
- The application now handles cases where elements aren't found in the store by refetching them
- The application works even when the backend is not available by using mock data
- The application supports both English and Russian languages
- Elements are stored separately for each language
